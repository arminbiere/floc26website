# About FLoC

During the past forty years, there has been extensive, continuous, and growing
interaction between logic and computer science. In many respects, logic provides
computer science with a unifying foundational framework and modeling tools.

In fact, logic has been called “the calculus of computer science,”
playing a crucial role in diverse areas such as artificial intelligence,
computational complexity, distributed computing, database systems, hardware
design, programming languages, and software engineering.

The Federated Logic Conference brings together several leading international
conferences related to mathematical logic and computer science.
